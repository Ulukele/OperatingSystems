# OperatingSystems
**Labs on Unix SVR4 System Calls and Libraries NSU course. For Solaris 10.**

I highly recommend downloading pdf files with theory if you want to read it because github's preview sometimes fails to display them correctly

If you're a second-year student of NSU found this repo, please remember that you need to learn to find information and get over bugs yourself or you'll be useless as a specialist. But, reading the theory that I collected may be useful.
